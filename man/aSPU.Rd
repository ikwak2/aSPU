\title{Sum of Powered Score (SPU) tests and adaptive SPU (aSPU) test for single trait - SNP set association.}
\usage{
aSPU(
  Y,
  X,
  cov = NULL,
  resample = c("perm", "boot", "sim"),
  model = c("gaussian", "binomial"),
  pow = c(1:8, Inf),
  n.perm = 1000,
  threshold = 10^5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Response or phenotype data. It can be a disease indicator; =0 for controls, =1 for cases.
Or it can be a quantitative trait. A vector with length n (number of observations).}

\item{X}{Genotype or other data; each row for a subject, and each column
for an SNP (or a predictor). The value of each SNP is the # of the copies
for an allele. A matrix with dimension n by k (n : number of observation, k : number of SNPs (or predictors) ).}

\item{cov}{Covariates. A matrix with dimension n by p (n :number of observation, p : number of covariates).}

\item{resample}{Use "perm" for residual permutations, "sim" for simulations from the null distribution, and "boot" for parametric bootstrap.}

\item{model}{Use "gaussian" for a quantitative trait, and use "binomial" for a binary trait.}

\item{pow}{power used in SPU test. A vector of the powers.}

\item{n.perm}{number of permutations or bootstraps.}

\item{threshold}{When n.perm is less than the threshold, we use faster version of aSPU but use more memory. (default is 10^5)}
}
\value{
A list object, Ts : test statistics for the SPU tests (in the order of the specified pow) and finally for the aSPU test.
        pvs : p-values for the SPU and aSPU tests.
}
\description{
It gives p-values of the SPU tests and aSPU test.
}
\examples{

data(exdat)

## example analysis using aSPU test on exdat data.
# increase n.perm for better p.val 
\dontrun{out <- aSPU(exdat$Y, exdat$X, cov = NULL, resample = "boot",
            model = "binomial", pow = c(1:8, Inf), n.perm = 1000) }
\dontshow{out <- aSPU(exdat$Y, exdat$X, cov = NULL, resample = "boot",
            model = "binomial", pow = c(1:8, Inf), n.perm = 10) }

out$Ts
# This is a vector of Test Statistics for SPU and aSPU tests.
# SPU1 to SPUInf corresponds with the option pow=c(1:8, Inf)
# They are SPU test statistics.
# The last element aSPU is minimum of them, aSPU statistic.

out$pvs
# This is a vector of p-values for SPU and aSPU tests.
# SPU1 to SPUInf corresponds with the option pow=c(1:8, Inf)
# They are p-values for corresponding SPU tests.
# The last element is p-value of aSPU test.
