Title: Adaptive Sum of Powered Score Test
Description: R codes for the (adaptive) Sum of Powered Score ('SPU' and 'aSPU')
    tests, inverse variance weighted Sum of Powered score ('SPUw' and 'aSPUw') tests
    and gene-based and some pathway based association tests (Pathway based Sum of
    Powered Score tests ('SPUpath'), adaptive 'SPUpath' ('aSPUpath') test, 'GEEaSPU'
    test for multiple traits - single 'SNP' (single-nucleotide-polymorphism)
    association in generalized estimation equations, 'MTaSPUs' test for multiple
    traits - single 'SNP' association with Genome Wide Association Studies ('GWAS')
    summary statistics, Gene-based Association Test that uses an extended Simes
    procedure ('GATES'), Hybrid Set-based Test ('HYST') and extended version
    of 'GATES' test for pathway-based association testing ('GATES-Simes'). ).
    The tests can be used with genetic and other data sets with covariates. The
    response variable is binary or quantitative. Summary; (1) Single trait-'SNP' set
    association with individual-level data ('aSPU', 'aSPUw'), (2) Single trait-'SNP'
    set association with summary statistics ('aSPUs'), (3) Single trait-pathway
    association with individual-level data ('aSPUpath'), (4) Single trait-pathway
    association with summary statistics ('aSPUsPath'), (5) Multiple traits-single
    'SNP' association with individual-level data ('GEEaSPU'), (6) Multiple traits-
    single SNP association with summary statistics ('MTaSPUs'), (7) Multiple traits-`SNP' set association with summary statistics(`MTaSPUsSet'), (8) Multiple traits-pathway association with summary statistics(`MTaSPUsSetPath').
